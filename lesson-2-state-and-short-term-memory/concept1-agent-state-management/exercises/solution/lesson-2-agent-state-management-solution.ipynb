    "# State Management for AI Agents - Simple Loan Approval Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Understand why **state management** is critical for AI agents\n",
    "- Learn how to preserve context across LLM calls\n",
    "- Build a simple state machine for a multi-step workflow\n",
    "- See the difference between stateless and stateful approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem: Stateless LLMs in Stateful Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are **stateless** - each API call is independent. But real workflows need **state** to:\n",
    "- Track progress through workflow phases (e.g., \"we're in the approval stage\")\n",
    "- Keep data from previous steps (e.g., \"we already validated the income\")\n",
    "- Make decisions based on accumulated context\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Loan Approval Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "A 3-step workflow:\n",
    "1. **VERIFY** - Verify applicant documents (deterministic)\n",
    "2. **ASSESS** - Use LLM to assess risk (AI)\n",
    "3. **DECIDE** - Make approval decision (rule-based)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step depends on data from the previous one!"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. State Machine**: Clear workflow stages (VERIFY → ASSESS → DECIDE → COMPLETED)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Context Preservation**: `LoanContext` holds all data across steps\n",
    "- Verified facts from Step 1 available in Step 3\n",
    "- LLM response from Step 2 available in Step 3\n",
    "- No data loss or recalculation needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. LLM Integration**: AI is used at specific points (Step 2) within a deterministic workflow\n",
    "- Not replacing the entire workflow with LLM\n",
    "- AI augments human-defined business logic\n",
    "- Results can be validated against rules\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Audit Trail**: Complete history of workflow execution\n",
    "- Every state transition is recorded\n",
    "- Decisions are traceable to specific steps\n",
    "- Regulatory compliance requirement\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Pattern Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reliability**: Deterministic workflow with clear states\n",
    "- **Observability**: Full audit trail for debugging\n",
    "- **Compliance**: Meets regulatory requirements for decision documentation\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Works for simple 3-step workflows or complex 20-step workflows\n",
    "- **LLM Limits**: Overcomes statelessness of LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is used in production for:\n",
    "- ✅ Loan/credit approval workflows\n",
    "- ✅ Compliance and KYC processes\n",
    "- ✅ Insurance claim processing\n",
    "- ✅ Customer onboarding\n",
    "- ✅ Order fulfillment\n",
    "- ✅ Any multi-step decision workflow"
