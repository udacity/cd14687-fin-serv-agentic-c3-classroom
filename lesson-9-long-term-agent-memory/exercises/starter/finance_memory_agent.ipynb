    "# Concept 1: Long-Term Agent Memory Management\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Build a finance assistant that persists client profiles in PostgreSQL and applies intelligent memory policies to maintain relevant context over extended sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features**:\n",
    "- 🧠 **Persistent Memory**: Store client facts in PostgreSQL with weights and TTL\n",
    "- 🔄 **Smart Updates**: Upsert new facts and resolve conflicts intelligently\n",
    "- ✂️ **Memory Pruning**: Remove stale, expired, or low-value memories\n",
    "- 📊 **Dynamic Reweighting**: Boost recent, frequent, or pinned memories\n",
    "- 📋 **Compact Digests**: Maintain focused profile summaries (≤12 items)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time**: ~15-20 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario**: A finance assistant that remembers client goals, risk tolerance, constraints, and bills across multiple sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ Memory Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Each memory entry contains:\n",
    "- **Core Data**: id, topic, fact_text, source\n",
    "- **Temporal**: created_at, updated_at, ttl_days\n",
    "- **Weighting**: weight, pinned, frequency_count\n",
    "- **Organization**: tags for categorization\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this exercise, you will:\n",
    "1. Design persistent memory schemas for AI agents\n",
    "2. Implement intelligent memory update and conflict resolution\n",
    "3. Create memory pruning policies with TTL and weight thresholds\n",
    "4. Build dynamic reweighting based on recency, frequency, and importance\n",
    "5. Generate compact memory digests for efficient context usage"

    "\n",
    "Your implementation should demonstrate:\n",
    "- ✅ **Session A**: Update → digest refresh during onboarding\n",
    "- ✅ **Session B**: Consistent context usage without re-asking\n",
    "- ✅ **Memory Operations**: At least one prune and one reweight event\n",
    "- ✅ **Digest Management**: Capped to ≤12 items with highest weights\n",
    "- ✅ **Technology Stack**: PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy + OpenAI integration\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Implementation Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic CRUD operations before adding intelligence\n",
    "2. **Test Incrementally**: Test each method as you implement it\n",
    "3. **Use LLM Effectively**: Design clear prompts for fact extraction and conflict detection\n",
    "4. **Handle Edge Cases**: Account for empty results, API errors, and invalid data\n",
    "5. **Focus on UX**: Provide clear feedback about memory operations to users\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck implementing your intelligent memory system! 🚀"
