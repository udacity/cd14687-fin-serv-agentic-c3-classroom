    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Understand OpenAI function calling mechanics in a business context\n",
    "- Learn to create tool schemas with proper validation\n",
    "- Practice forcing specific tool execution with ```tool_choice```\n",
    "- Implement error handling for tool calls\n",
    "- Work with financial calculation tools\n",
