    "# Customer Support Dispute Intake Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **short-term memory management** for multi-turn conversations in a customer support context.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conversation History Management**: Last-k message window to prevent context overflow\n",
    "2. **Sliding Session Summary**: Running 3-5 bullet summary updated after each turn\n",
    "3. **State vs Memory Distinction**: Captured fields (state) vs conversation facts (memory)\n",
    "4. **Memory-Driven Consistency**: Avoiding re-asking for known information\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "Customer support intake for card transaction disputes where customers describe issues over multiple turns, and the assistant must remember previous details without repetition."

    "6. If you can infer information from the session summary, acknowledge it and ask for confirmation\n",
    "7. If all info is collected, offer to generate the dispute summary\n",
    "8. Keep responses concise (2-3 sentences max)\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of what NOT to do:\n",
    "- Don't ask for merchant if they already mentioned \"Uber\"\n",
    "- Don't ask for amount if they already said \"$15.50\"\n",
    "- Don't ask for date if they said \"July 2nd\"\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. **Short-Term Memory Components**\n",
    "- **Conversation History**: Last-k message window (configurable, here k=4)\n",
    "- **Session Summary**: 3-5 bullet points of key facts updated after each turn\n",
    "- **Structured State**: Captured dispute fields separate from conversational memory\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Memory vs State Distinction**\n",
    "- **State**: Structured data fields (card_last4, merchant, amount, etc.)\n",
    "- **Memory**: Conversational facts and context preserved across turns\n",
    "- **Integration**: Memory informs responses while state tracks progress\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Sliding Window Benefits**\n",
    "- **Context Limits**: Prevents token overflow in long conversations\n",
    "- **Relevancy**: Recent turns + summary maintain continuity\n",
    "- **Performance**: Faster processing with bounded history\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Consistency Through Memory**\n",
    "- **No Re-asking**: Assistant never asks for already captured information\n",
    "- **Context Awareness**: References previous details naturally\n",
    "- **Progressive Collection**: Builds understanding over multiple turns\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Production Considerations**\n",
    "- **Persistence**: In production, store memory in databases/sessions\n",
    "- **Tuning**: Adjust window size based on context limits and use case\n",
    "- **Recovery**: Handle memory corruption and session restoration\n",
    "- **Privacy**: Clear memory appropriately for data protection"
