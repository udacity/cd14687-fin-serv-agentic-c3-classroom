    "# Customer Support Dispute Intake Assistant - EXERCISE\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll implement **short-term memory management** for multi-turn conversations in a customer support context.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this exercise, you will:\n",
    "1. Implement conversation history with sliding window management\n",
    "2. Create and maintain a running session summary\n",
    "3. Distinguish between state (captured fields) and memory (conversation facts)\n",
    "4. Prevent repetition by using memory to track known information\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a customer support assistant that helps customers file card transaction disputes. The assistant must:\n",
    "- Remember details from previous turns without re-asking\n",
    "- Maintain a sliding window of conversation history (last k turns)\n",
    "- Keep a running session summary (3-5 key facts)\n",
    "- Extract structured dispute information progressively\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏦 Scenario\n",
    "Customers describe transaction disputes over multiple conversation turns. Your assistant needs to collect all required fields while maintaining context and avoiding repetition."

    "## 📚 Implementation Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1: Conversation History with Sliding Window\n",
    "- Create a `ConversationTurn` object with user_input, assistant_response, and timestamp\n",
    "- Add to `self.conversation_history` list  \n",
    "- Use list slicing: `self.conversation_history[-self.max_history_turns:]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2: Session Summary Management\n",
    "- Build prompt with current summary and new user input\n",
    "- Ask LLM to extract 3-5 key facts about transaction details, context, dispute reasoning\n",
    "- Parse response into list of strings\n",
    "- Keep only last 5 items: `self.session_summary[-5:]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 3: Information Extraction\n",
    "- Show LLM the current captured fields to avoid duplicates\n",
    "- Request JSON format with only new/updated information\n",
    "- Use `json.loads()` to parse response\n",
    "- Update `self.dispute_data` attributes with `setattr()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 4: Memory-Aware Response Generation\n",
    "- Include session summary in prompt to show context awareness\n",
    "- Include recent conversation history (last 2-3 turns)\n",
    "- Check captured vs missing fields to avoid re-asking\n",
    "- Keep responses professional and concise (2-3 sentences)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 5: Final Summary Generation\n",
    "- Use captured dispute data and session summary\n",
    "- Format as professional handoff: Card, Merchant, Amount, Date, Channel, Claim, Notes\n",
    "- Keep under 8 lines total\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "Your implementation should:\n",
    "- ✅ Never re-ask for information already captured\n",
    "- ✅ Maintain context across multiple turns\n",
    "- ✅ Work correctly when conversation history is truncated\n",
    "- ✅ Generate accurate final dispute summary\n",
    "- ✅ Complete the intake process in ~15-20 minutes"
