    "# Short-Term Memory Demo: Financial Advisor Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo shows how **short-term memory management** enables natural multi-turn conversations in a financial advisory context.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "A financial advisor AI assistant helps clients with:\n",
    "- Investment planning and recommendations\n",
    "- Retirement account guidance\n",
    "- Risk assessment and portfolio rebalancing\n",
    "- Financial goal tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "The assistant must remember client financial profile and preferences across the conversation without re-asking.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Memory Components Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conversation History** - Last-k message sliding window\n",
    "2. **Session Summary** - 3-5 key facts about the client's financial situation\n",
    "3. **Profile Tracking** - Structured data extraction (income, risk tolerance, goals)\n",
    "4. **Context-Aware Responses** - No repetitive questions\n",
    "\n",

      "💰 ADVISOR: It's great to hear you're considering maximizing your 401k. Given your conservative risk tolerance and the importance of both your retirement and home purchase goals, I recommend contributing enough to your 401k to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, you can assess how much additional contribution you can make without compromising your savings for the house in the next 5 years. Would you like to discuss how to balance these contributions effectively?\n",

    "### Memory Management Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "This financial advisor assistant demonstrates the short-term memory pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "**3 Memory Components**:\n",
    "1. ✅ **Conversation History** - Sliding window of recent turns\n",
    "2. ✅ **Session Summary** - 3-5 key facts about the client's financial situation\n",
    "3. ✅ **Structured Data** - Extracted client profile (age, risk tolerance, goals)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits**:\n",
    "- **No Repetition**: Never re-asks for known information (age, risk tolerance, etc.)\n",
    "- **Personalization**: Recommendations based on complete financial profile\n",
    "- **Context Continuity**: Maintains conversation thread across topics\n",
    "- **Efficient**: Bounded memory prevents token overflow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Financial Services Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is essential for financial AI agents:\n",
    "- 💰 **Investment Advisory** (this demo) - Portfolio recommendations and retirement planning\n",
    "- 💳 **Customer Dispute Intake** - Gathering transaction details and resolution preferences\n",
    "- 🏦 **Loan Applications** - Collecting income, credit, and property information\n",
    "- 📊 **Financial Planning** - Understanding goals, timeline, and risk tolerance\n",
    "- 🔒 **Fraud Detection** - Tracking patterns and customer verification\n",
    "- 💼 **Wealth Management** - Long-term client relationship management\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Real financial services systems need:\n",
    "- **Compliance**: Ensure memory practices meet regulatory requirements (GDPR, CCPA)\n",
    "- **Security**: Encrypt sensitive financial data in memory and storage\n",
    "- **Audit Trails**: Log all interactions for compliance and dispute resolution\n",
    "- **Persistence**: Store client profiles in secure databases\n",
    "- **Privacy**: Clear PII appropriately and follow data retention policies\n",
    "- **Multi-Session**: Link memory across different conversation sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "But the **core 3-component pattern remains consistent**!"
